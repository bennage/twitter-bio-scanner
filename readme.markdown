This is my shameless ripoff of 
https://github.com/bennage/twitter-bio-scanner

Especially the list of stop words! Thanks John.

It reads the bios of your followers and creates a list of words sorted by how frequently they appear.

To run this, first clone the repo. Then install the dependencies by running (in the repo's directory)
`npm install`

Then you'll need to create a twitter app here:
https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

and also create the access token.

Fill the values into the source:
    consumer_key: '',
    consumer_secret: '',
    access_token_key: '',
    access_token_secret: ''
